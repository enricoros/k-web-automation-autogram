AutoGram - Anagram Solver (+ WordChallenge automation)
------------------------------------------------------

This project is a mix of different small things:

- algorithms (anagram making and dictionary validation)
- image processing (training and recognition of patterns)
- input injection (
- screen grabbing (ok, that's a oneliner :-))

How to GET it
=============

**Windows**: Right now there is no executable file ready for download.
If you're a developer you can compile your own out of the source code, as
described below.

**Linux / Windows / Mac OSX developers**
Just get the source code from http://www.gitorious.org/web-automation/autogram and
open it with [QtCreator](http://www.qtsoftware.com/products/developer-tools), so you can
Build and Run it.
(or, if you prefer, you can do the usual "qmake; make;" stuff on the console if you like more ;-))

How to USE it
=============

 1. login to facebook and start the WordChallenge application
 2. start autogram
 3. tune the capture rectangle to center it to the 6 letters **this step is very important**
 4. switch to the 'WordChallenge' mode
 5. let 'autogram' PLAY, and BEAT all your friends!
 6. tell them you're not evil, but you're cheating ;-)
